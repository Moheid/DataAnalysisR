Description: This a fairly simple web scrapping solution. It saves job ads from 
    indeed.com as text files and then, for 
    each job ad a search for sentences is performed and saved. 
    After collecting the sentences, the report looks for keywords 
    identified around knowledge skills and abilities (KSA's).
    The code is written in R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02), 
    using packages listed in 00_installPkgs.R, 
    developed on a x86_64-pc-linux-gnu platform.
