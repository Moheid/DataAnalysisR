The Implementation studies (IS) for Learning paths (LP) and Towards Data 
Stewardship (DM) are proposing a a web scrapping solution to search for job ads 
and look for descriptions of knowledge skills and abilities (KSA's). 
The current report uses external data that has been saved in doc, docx and pdf 
files. The raw text of these files has then been extracted and saved.
This reports shows a collection of sentences identified around 
KSA's.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. The code has been 
hidden to show only results.

The R packages used for the search are `tidyverse` and `here`:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Loads custome function

    map(list.files(path = path, pattern = pattern, full.names = TRUE), 
        read_csv)
}
```

```{r include=FALSE}
safely_ReadMyDataFiles <- safely(ReadMyDataFiles)

```

```{r include=FALSE}
allsentences <- 
    check1$result %>%
    map_df(~(.))

dim(allsentences)

```{r include=FALSE}

# means `starts with`, otherwise the keyword will be searched in any part of the 
#sentence.

## Skills

```{r echo=FALSE}

## Abilities
